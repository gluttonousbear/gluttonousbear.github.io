				  	This is great after a workout, or any sort of draining activity. It immediately puts a smile on my face despite being a salad.
				  	It is laden with protein and fats. In this one, the ingredients are somewhat interchangable. I would not recommend to cut out 
				  	the cheese, but you can skip the sour cream, if you want a lighter version. You can also add beans (refried, or basic). Oh and 
				  	if you love salsa, or pico de gallo, then feel free to add that as well.  The blend of spice, fat, freshness and the crunchy texture
				  	this produces is phenomenal. As usual with my mexican influenced recipes, I think the country of origin is actually the US.
				  	<br />
				  <h5>The Taco Shell</h5>
					First off, to produce the taco shell, which you will use as a salad bowl (YAY to edible salad bowl!) you need some sort of small
				  	pot or bowl that is ovenproof (please don't use any with cheap plastic etc.). Sprinkle a bit of water on the tortilla to soften it up.
				  	Then sparingly spread some oil on the tortilla, you don't want it dripping. Place the tortilla on your dish and press down the edges, so
					the tortilla can form a salad bowl. Bake in the oven at 150°C for 5-7 minutes, or until crispy (and slightly brown). 
				  	<br /><br />
				  <h5>The Salad</h5>
				  	Fry up half of the onion and beef and add salt, pepper, cayenne, cumin. Meanwhile, finely chop tomatoes and mix with avocado meat and the
				  	other half of the onion. Sprinkle with the juice from half of the lime. Add salt, pepper, cumin and chopped cilantro. Blend until guacamole :).
				  	Cut lettuce into strips. Fill the bowl with the ingredients. If you like molten cheese, add it on the hot beef, otherwise, just add it on top
				  	with guacamole and sour cream. Personally I could die for molten cheese, but a good cheddar is just as good cold.
