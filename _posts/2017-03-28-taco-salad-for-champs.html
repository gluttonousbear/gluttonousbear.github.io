				  	This one's great for a dinner party, a cookover, or for a gluttonous breakfast.<br />
					Boil eggs until hard. Scare them cold (with tap water). Peel them. Take a spoon, mix the egg yolks with the ingredients, flavor with salt and pepper to taste. 
					Now the interesting part begins, you either take the poverty approach and use a spoon to but the yolk-mass back into the egg-whites (like I do, unless I have
					guests), or you use a small plastic bag (e.g. one for freezing things), fill it up and cut a small hole into the corner. Then you squeeze out the mass until the eggs look
					delicious enough to devour them in one sitting. Success.<br /><br />
