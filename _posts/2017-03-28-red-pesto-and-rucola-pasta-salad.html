				  	Ever heard people talk shit about monosodium glutamate? Well, the amount of additives in industrial produce isn't ideal. However, dried tomatoes have a naturally high content
				  	and will make it very hard for you and your friends to put the fork down after trying this recipe! <br /><br /> 
				  	
				  	DISCLAIMER: If you don't need this to be vegan, and you can live with the excess calories
				  	you can also add parmesan, which I recommend for the gluttons out there. It isn't necessary however, so it's not included in the calorie table.<br />
				  
				  <h5>Preparation</h5>Directions are pretty straightforward. Boil pasta until al dente. Roast pine nuts without oil in a pan until brown (not black). Cut cocktail tomatoes in half,
				  	finely chop dried tomatoes (If they come in oil, drain the oil, if they are really dry, let them soak in the pesto rosso for a few hours). Add all the ingredients
				  and spices (<b>except the rucola!</b>) and let sit for an hour or more. When served, add fresh rucola on top and enjoy!
