				  This is very easy to make. All you need is a big pot and patience. The flavors come out very distinctive in this one, as
          the long cooking time allows the meat to assimilate all spices.<br />
				  <h5>Preparation</h5>
					Cut up chicken breast into medium sized chunks. Form doesn't matter, so this can be done quick. Chop onion. Throw all 
          ingredients into a big pot, <b>add some water</b> and let lightly boil on medium for 3-4 hours. After that take
          two forks and pull that chicken apart. Let simmer for another hour or until the water has evaporated and all that's left
          is saucy, steamy BBQ-chicken. Eat with whatever you like, I like it to cauliflower pur√©e and salad, as seen in the pictures. 
          Refrigerates well, so you can make more at one time and leave it in the fridge. Even tastes good cold.
