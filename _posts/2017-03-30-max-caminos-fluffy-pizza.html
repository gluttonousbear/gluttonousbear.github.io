          As simple as it seems, this dough has proven to consistently result in some of the best pizzas I have eaten to date, even
          though it is made in a common kitchen oven at only 200° C. It is more in line with an american pizza, due to its thick and
          fluffy consistency than the italian counterpart. 
         <h5>Preparation</h5>
          Start with 500g of flour. Dissolve yeast cube in the room tempered water. Add water, salt and olive oil to the flour and
          knead for about 5 minutes with your hands, or a kitchen appliance. If the dough seems to be too solid, add 10 ml of milk.
          Put the dough into a large bowl and cover with a piece of cloth. Let the bowl rest in a warm spot for about 30 minutes to
          an hour.<br /><br />

          After the dough has risen to about twice its size, take out of the bowl, spread additional flour on your working surface 
          and begin forming a pizza of your favorite shape. Bake in the oven at 200°C for about 12-15 minutes, or until finished.<br />
