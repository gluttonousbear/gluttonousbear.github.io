		 This dish is inspired by the greek meal of gemista, wherein vegetables are stuffed with various fillings. The filling itself can be varied, but
		 for the ideal vegetarian experience, a main of either bulgur, rice or couscous and a protein and fat-rich side like feta is recommended.
		 The scallions and fresh parsley give this dish a nice fresh touch, the garlic, cumin and veggie stock give it taste and the cheese brings
		 everything together.
          
         <h5>Preparation</h5>
          Pre-heat oven to 200°C. Slice the bell peppers in half, cut out the interior. Place with the cut edge on baking paper. Put in the hot oven
		  for 10 minutes. Meanwhile cook bulgur with a pinch of salt according to the packaging. Cut up scallions, feta, parsley and garlic. Mix in with
		  the cooked bulgur. Season with salt and pepper, as well as a generous amount of cumin. <br /><br />
		  
		  Fill bell peppers with the mixture, take 500ml of warm water, mix in vegetable broth and slowly pour over the bell peppers. You don't have
		  to use all of the water, just enough to soak the mixture . Place in the middle of the oven at 200°C for 10 minutes. Then place the baking
		  plate near the top of the oven for additional 3-5 minutes, or until the edges of the peppers start caramelizing. Let everything rest for a few minutes.
		  You can eat this just the way it is, or with some nice zatziki.
